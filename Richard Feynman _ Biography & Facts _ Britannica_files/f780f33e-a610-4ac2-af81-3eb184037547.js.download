He promoted the narrative that Germany would have won World War I had it not been “stabbed in the back” by corrupt politicians and undermined by a supposed “worldwide Jewish conspiracy” - one of the many conspiracy theories condoned by Hitler.

The Bretton Woods conference in 1944 solidified America's position as global financial leader as the US Dollar replaced the British Pound as the primary currency in international transactions.

Philip Randolph succeeded in ending discrimination in military defense hiring and set up the Fair Employment Practices Commission, which led to more than a million African Americans taking on manufacturing positions during the war. Even though more than 1 million Black Americans and 500,000 Mexican Americans answered the call to war, they still faced discrimination culminating in events like the Detroit race riots and the Zoot Suit Riot in Los Angeles. Eventually, schools and the military began to integrate, but full desegregation of the US military would not happen until 1948 when Truman signed Executive Order 9981; unfortunately it would not be until years later in 1954 when Brown v.

He appealed his conviction to the US Supreme Court, where, in one of the worst decisions in Supreme Court history, the Court ruled that the need to protect against supposed Japanese espionage outweighed the Constitutional rights of Japanese-Americans.
