<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p align="justify">In particle physics, an <b>elementary particle</b> or <b>fundamental particle</b> is a subatomic particle with no substructure,
 i.e. it is not composed of other particles. Particles currently thought to be elementary include the fundamental fermions 
(quarks, leptons, antiquarks, and antileptons), which generally are "matter particles" and "antimatter particles", 
as well as the fundamental bosons (gauge bosons and the Higgs boson), which generally are "force particles" that mediate interactions among fermions.
A particle containing two or more elementary particles is called a composite particle.</p>
<p align="justify">
Ordinary matter is composed of atoms, once presumed to be elementary particles—atom meaning "unable to cut" 
in Greek—although the atom's existence remained controversial until about 1905, as some leading physicists 
regarded molecules as mathematical illusions, and matter as ultimately composed of energy. 
Subatomic constituents of the atom were first identified in the early 1930s; the electron and the proton, 
along with the photon, the particle of electromagnetic radiation. At that time, the recent advent of quantum mechanics 
was radically altering the conception of particles, as a single particle could seemingly span a field as would a wave, a paradox 
still eluding satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p align="justify">
Via quantum theory, protons and neutrons were found to contain quarks – up quarks and down quarks – now considered elementary particles.
And within a molecule, the electron's three degrees of freedom (charge, spin, orbital) can separate via the wavefunction into three quasiparticles 
(holon, spinon, and orbiton). Yet a free electron – one which is not orbiting an atomic nucleus and hence lacks orbital motion – appears unsplittable
 and remains regarded as an elementary particle.</p>
<p align="justify">
Around 1980, an elementary particle's status as indeed elementary – an ultimate constituent of substance – was mostly discarded for
 a more practical outlook, embodied in particle physics' Standard Model, what's known as science's most experimentally successful theory.
Many elaborations upon and theories beyond the Standard Model, including the popular supersymmetry, double the number of elementary particles
 by hypothesizing that each known particle associates with a "shadow" partner far more massive, although all such superpartners remain undiscovered.
 Meanwhile, an elementary boson mediating gravitation – the graviton – remains hypothetical. Also, as hypotheses indicate, spacetime is probably quantized,
 so there most likely exist "atoms" of space and time itself.</p>

<h3>The Standard Model</h3>

<p align="justify">
The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary fermions, 
plus their corresponding antiparticles, as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the Higgs boson, 
which was reported on July 4, 2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ATLAS and CMS).
 However, the Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, 
since it is not known if it is compatible with Einstein's general relativity. There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model,
 such as the graviton, the particle that would carry the gravitational force, and sparticles, supersymmetric partners of the ordinary particles.</p>

<h4>Quarks</h4>
<p align="justify">
Isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by confinement. Every quark carries one of three color charges of the strong interaction; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles interact via gluon exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via photon exchange. However, gluons are themselves color-charged, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the electromagnetic force, which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.</p>
<p align="justify">
However, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral composite particles called hadrons. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral meson. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being "red", another "blue", another "green". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral baryon. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors "antired", "antiblue" and "antigreen" can form a color-neutral antibaryon.</p>
<p align="justify">
Quarks also carry fractional electric charges, but, since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either +​2⁄3 or −​1⁄3, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either −​2⁄3 or +​1⁄3.</p>
<p align="justify">
Evidence for the existence of quarks comes from deep inelastic scattering: firing electrons at nuclei to determine the distribution of charge within nucleons (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the electric field around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a jet of particles is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.                
</p> 


<h4>Gluons</h4>
<p align="justify">
Gluons mediate the strong interaction, which join quarks and thereby form hadrons, which are either baryons (three quarks) or mesons (one quark and one antiquark). 
Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the atomic nucleus. Like quarks, gluons exhibit color and
 anticolor – unrelated to the concept of visual color and rather the particles' strong interactions – sometimes in combinations,
 altogether eight variations of gluons.</p>

<h4>Electroweak bosons</h4>
<p align="justify">
There are three weak gauge bosons: W+, W−, and Z0; these mediate the weak interaction.
 The W bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay: The W− converts a neutron into a proton then decays into an electron and
 electron-antineutrino pair. The Z0 does not convert particle flavor or charges, but rather changes momentum;
 it is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-Z exchange.
 The massless photon mediates the electromagnetic interaction. These four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles. </p>               

<h4>Higgs boson</h4>
<p align="justify">
Although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies,
 the two forces are theorized to unify as a single electroweak force at high energies.
 This prediction was clearly confirmed by measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at the HERA collider at DESY.
 The differences at low energies is a consequence of the high masses of the W and Z bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the Higgs mechanism.
 Through the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles
 to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain with an undefined rest mass as it is always in motion (the photon). On 4 July 2012,
 after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its existence, the Higgs boson was announced to have been observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.
 Peter Higgs who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson was present at the announcement.
 The Higgs boson is believed to have a mass of approximately 125 GeV. The statistical significance of this discovery was reported as 5 sigma,
 which implies a certainty of roughly 99.99994%. In particle physics,
 this is the level of significance required to officially label experimental observations as a discovery.
 Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues.</p>

<h4>Graviton</h4>
<p align="justify">
The graviton is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation.
 While it remains undiscovered due to the difficulty inherent in its detection,
 it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles. The conventional graviton is massless, although there exist models containing massive
 Kaluza–Klein gravitons.</p>
